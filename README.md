# Convifai

Convifai is an AI-driven voice dialogue app utilizing speech recognition, language processing and voice generation ai models, for a seamless, voice-based conversation. The goal is that people who simply want to improve their speaking of a particular language can have a conversation with a language processing model such as Chat-GPT before speaking to real people.

## Components (Frameworks)

**Frontend**:

- React.js as frontend framework
- Tailwind css for styling

**Backend**:

- Flask as the main backend
- Fastapi for the centralized token management system
- MySQL Database

The Backend then communicates to my selfbuild AIHub to use the different AI services.
